#+TITLE: c-hash-table

* Introduction.

My implementation of a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table][hash table]]
in the C language, following
[[https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table][this]]
tutorial by jamesroutley. I created this in order to further my C knowledge and
it's probably not at all useable in production, in the current state. Should
this little project prove to be useful to me I will eventually improve it.

Currently this creates hash tables that are
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing][open-addressed]]
and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hashing][double-hashed]].

* Methods (API).

#+BEGIN_SRC C
/* Create a new hash table */
ht_hash_table* ht = ht_new_table();

/* Put an item into the hash table */
/* DEF: void ht_insert(ht, const char* key, const char* val) */
ht_insert(ht, "name", "user1");

/* Search for an item */
/* DEF: char* ht_search(ht_hash_table* ht, const char* key) */
ht_search(ht, "name"); // returns item value - "user1"

/* Delete an item */
/* DEF: void ht_delete(ht_hash_table* ht, const char* key) */
ht_delete(ht, "name");

/* Delete a hash table */
/* DEF: void ht_del_hash_table(ht_hash_table* ht) */
ht_del_hash_table(ht);
